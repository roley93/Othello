# Barry University 2016 CS-311-01 Assembly Project: Othello Board Game

This was my final project in my assembly core course. We were tasked to recreate the game called Othello, also known as Reversi. 
We had to use Windows Programming and some C++ macros made the project easier to develop. 

## Rules of the game:
Here is a brief overview how to play the game:

The project is not 100% finished, I still have to implement the winning state of the game, otherwise the game is functional.
